# Test_YHCR_SK
Code Test

This project is an extention of the original code availabel in ViewYHCR project. This project was created as a playground to experiment with different visualization and data creation techniques.
This can be used as a testing environment before making changes to the original code.

The 0-1 matrix dataset is created using this project. To make sure this project executes the results, a data folder will have to be created inside the static folder and approproiate JSON and CSV files have to be uploaded in it. This is because a subset of data was used to develop a working prototype for the project.
The Python flask code with SQL queries fetch the data from the YHCR GCP platform automatically. To facilitate it, the local system should have Google Cloud shell installed in it and it should be logged in using the NHS account having access to the YHCR GCP platform.

Then run the commands mentioned in the mail from Deloitte IT support, on the visual studio code platform, and you will be able to connect to the database instantly.
